This Icelandic version is unusual in that it is possible to lead several cards at the same time, and that the 6♣ is the highest card.

Rules
-----

From 2-4 players play with a 52-card pack in which the cards rank from Ace (high) down to Two (low) as usual, except for the six of clubs, which is higher than all other cards including aces. In the first hand, 10 cards are dealt to each player, in the second hand 9 cards, and so on, reducing the hand size by one in each new deal.

The player to the left of the dealer begins and may lead a single card or any number of equal cards - for example two eights or three jacks. If a single card is led, the rule is the same as in Denmark and elsewhere: subsequent players must beat or equal the highest card in the trick or play their lowest card. If more than one card is led, subsequent players must each player an equal number of cards. These cards need not be equal to each other, but they must be at least as high as the highest set of cards so far played to the trick, or the lowest cards that the player has. For example if 5-5-5 is led, the next player might play 5-9-J, on which the following player could play 8-Q-K. The fourth player, holding for example 2, 2, 4, 7, 7, J, J, A cannot play higher or equal; having used the ace to beat the king there is no other card in the hand that is as good as the queen. Therefore this player would be forced to play 2-2-4.

The trick is won by the player of the highest card or set, or by the last of equally high cards or sets, and the winner leads to the next trick. Players must keep a single card for the last trick. Even if your last cards are equal - for example a pair of 4's - you cannot lead them both at once. The winner of the final single card trick scores a penalty equal to the value of that card (Ace=14, King=13, Queen=12, Jack=11, 10-2 face value). This is indicated by storing the losing card in front of the player while the remaining cards are shuffled for the next deal. There is no bonus for having a card equal to the losing card. The club6 has a value of 21 points.

A player who has a total score of more than 21 (as indicated by the sum of the cards in front of the player) drops out of the game, while the remaining players continue playing. The last surviving player is the winner.

A player who has a score of exactly 21 points returns to zero and remains in the game. The player's scoring cards are shuffled back into the pack.

Note that a player who has the club6 as the last card will lose the hand since this is the highest card in the pack. If the player has previously lost a hand, this will take the player's score over 21 and the player is eliminated from the game. On the other hand if the player has no previous scoring cards, the club6 creates a score of 21 which becomes 0 and the player stays in the game.

Variants
--------

Some play that before leading to the first trick, the player to dealer's left may discard some cards and draw an equal number of replacements from the undealt cards. In that case each other player has the opportunity to discard and draw before the play begins, with the restriction that the number of cards discarded must be less than or equal to the number discarded by the first player.

Some play with the two black sevens as equal high cards, in which case the six of clubs is just an ordinary six. In one version the spade7 is highest, counting 16 points and the club7 is second highest, counting 15 points. In another, the two black sevens are equal highest, counting 21 points each.

Some play with the Swedish rule that it is only necessary to beat the previous card, not the highest card in the trick.

Some play with just 5 cards dealt to each player throughout. Some play with a different sequence of deals: first 6 cards each, then reducing one card at a time to 1, then increasing to 5, reducing to 1, increasing to 4, reducing to 1, etc. The result of a 1-card deal is of course pure chance.
