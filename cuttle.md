Cuttle 
======

Rules taken and cleaned from: http://www.pagat.com/combat/cuttle.html

Even though Cuttle is a game for two players, we have played it with three as well.
With more it will become very hard to finish the game.

## Cards

The game is played with one standard deck.

## Definitions
* Increasing suit order: standard
* Increasing rank order: A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K
* The A is worth 1 point, the cards in the range \[2,10\] are worth their number of points. These will be called *point cards*.

## Play

Play begins with the dealer, who deals six cards to himself and five to his opponent. The remaining cards go on a drawing deck. The opponent then takes the first turn.
Next to the drawing deck there is a scrap pile, initially empty, in which cards can be put face-up.

A player taking a turn has two options, to draw a card or to play a card.

### Winning

If the player has a number of point cards in front of him with a total value of 21 or more, that player has won.

### Card actions

In the case the player decides to play a card, he has the following options.

1. Any card in the range \[A,10\] may be played as a *point card*. In this case, the player puts the card face-up on the table in front of him.

2. Any numbered card in the range \[A,10\] may be played as a *scuttle*. In this case, it is played on top of any point card of the opponent which it exceeds in value, or if it is equal in value it must exceed it in color. Both cards are then moved directly to the scrap pile.

3. Play an *action card*.

To make a distinction between point cards and action cards when on the table, place them in a different direction.

Card  | Ability
----  | -------
Ace   | Put all point cards on the table on the scrap pile.
Two   | Move any non-point card on the table to the scrap pile. 
Three | Rummage through the scrap pile, taking a card of your choice into your hand.
Four  | Draw two cards randomly from your opponent and move these to the scrap pile.
Five  | You may draw two cards.
Six   | All played cards on the table except for point cards are moved into the scrap pile.
Seven | Draw a card. You must play this drawn card immediately - whether as a point card, a scuttle, a one-off, whatever is allowed. If you are unable to play the card, it is discarded.
Eight | Place this card in front of your opponent. While the card remains there, your opponent has to show all the cards in his hand to all other players. (Hint to remember: an 8 on its side looks like glasses.)
Nine  | Return any effect card on the table to its controller's hand. This player may not play that card in his next turn, only in the turn after that.
Jack  | Place it on top of a point card already on the table. With the jack on top, the card is moved across the table and is now owned by the opponent of its original owner.
Queen | Place it on the table on your side. With a Queen in play, none of your other cards except the queen itself may be the target of opposing cards that target a single card (generally speaking) except scuttle cards. (For example, it protects against Jacks, twos, and nines but not Aces and Sixes, even if those happen to effect only one card.)
King  | Played like Queens. With a King in play, a player can win with just 14 points worth of point cards on the table. With two Kings he needs just ten, with three, seven points, and with all four just five points! (To sum up, a player needs 21/(1.5^k) points to win, where k is the number of Kings controlled by that player).

Note that a Ten cannot be played as an action card.


### Special counterattack rule

During your opponents turn, you can play a Two to remove any non-point card he played in that same turn to the scrap pile.

### Special rule when the draw deck is empty

When there are no more cards to be drawn, a player can either play a card or pass. When both players pass after each other, the game is a draw.

FAQ
---

###  Do Queens protect against "countering" twos?

> The second most common question I am asked :-). The answer is yes: Queens prevent the targeting of any single card controlled by that player, however briefly.

### May a two be used to cancel an opponent's two?

> Absolutely! A last-in, first-out order seems the only sensible one to employ - ie in this situation the last-played card (the second two) moves the first to the scrap pile. From there it cannot effect the game, so the original card is played unscathed.

### May I use a three to rummage for the three I just played?

> I don't think so. Since cards in the scrap pile do not affect the game, I believe a card sits in a kind of suspension until its effect has been resolved. This also gives clarity to the protection of one-offs by Queens.

### Suppose the only point card on the table is mine, and my one-off seven comes up as a Jack. What happens

> To me, the only logical answer is that the card switches sides, with the Jack on top of it!

### This game has similarities with Magic: The Gathering!

> It's been remarked on. It does however predate it considerably - I learnt the rules in 1975. A reverse genealogy would be fascinating - I would love to know if Richard Garfield has heard of the game.

### An easier way to remember Cuttle effects as a MTG player

piato on Reddit [gave these tips](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/2ye2yc/theres_a_standard_playing_card_game_from_1975/cp8xzpe):

> "Point cards" are creatures. You win if you have 21 power on the table. J/Q/K are enchantments.

> A: Wrath 2: Dispel / Disenchant (split card) 3: Regrowth 4: Mind Rot 5: Divination 6: Back to Nature 7: draw a card and play it immediately (Chandra +0?) 8: Glasses of Urza 9: Boomerang 10: - J: Mind Control Q: Defense Grid + Privileged Position K: Your creatures have power * 1.5

> (Note that the Instant/Sorcery status of those cards isn't quite right - everything in the game is at "sorcery speed" (i.e. on your turn, and the only thing you do on your turn), except for the counterspell mode of 2s. Which makes the counters into Flusterstorms or something, since they can't hit "creatures", scuttles (um, evoking shriekmaw I guess?) or "enchantments".)

### The 9 doesn't seem very useful as a one-off:

piato on Reddit [says](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/2ye2yc/theres_a_standard_playing_card_game_from_1975/cp99ehj):

> I don't know what's going on with the rule for 9s, but they're completely useless as stated. John M (who runs pagat.com, which hosts the Sipie FAQ) suggested that he may have meant "bounce a card and it can't be replayed that turn", which makes a ton more sense.


Variations
----------

 * Instead of the 4's one-off being a **Choice Discard**, make it a **Random Discard**. It can possibly improves the game once you hit a reasonably high level, putting pressure on 2's and encouraging attacking play. On the other hand, choice 4's are skill-testing when you're just learning the game, so swings and roundabouts I guess. (suggested by [piato](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/2ye2yc/theres_a_standard_playing_card_game_from_1975/cp99ehj))
