This repo aims to define rules of card games in an unambiguous way.

## General definitions

* There are four suits/colors, by default in the increasing order :clubs: (clubs) :diamonds: (diamonds) :hearts: (hearts) and :spades: (spades). A helpful way to remember suit order is that they are alphabetical, Clubs - Diamonds - Hearts - Spades.
* :clubs: and :spades: are black, :diamonds: and :hearts: are red.
* There are 13 numbers, by default in the increasing order of 2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10- J (jack) - Q (queen) - K (king) - A (ace).
* A standard deck of cards consists of 52 cards. Each card has exactly one number and one color, such that no two distinct cards have exactly the same number and color.
* For a certain suit S, the off-Jack (abbrev. offJ) is the Jack of the color T which is not equal to S, but which is red if S is red and black when S is black.
* The standard direction of play is clockwise (negative direction).
* A person P to the left of a person Q is sitting such that the left side of Q is facing towards P.
