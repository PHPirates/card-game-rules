Durak can be played with two up to and including six players.

The game is played with the numbers \[6, A\] (standard rank order) of a standard deck.

## Definitions
* Increasing rank order: standard

## Play

### Deal

The dealer deals six cards to each player, one card open on the table and the remaining cards in a stack face down crosswise on the open card.

The open card is the card which determines trump.
The first time, the player which holds the lowest trump card starts (but not necessarily with that card).
In next games, the player left to the dealer will start.

### Losing

You cannot win this game, but the last person with cards in his hand is the loser.

### A turn

#### An attack

On the start of your turn, you will attack the player to your left by placing a card open on the table.
This player then has two options,

1. pick up all the cards on the table (so initially this is one card),
2. if the suit is not trump, then either play a trump or a higher card of the same suit; if the suit is trump, then defend with a higher trump card.

In case the cards were picked up, so the attack succeeded, 
 the player to the left of the defender starts his turn.
 
In case the card was defended, the attacker has two options,

1. play a card which has a value equal to one of the cards on the table,
2. ask the player to the left of the defender to help, in which case he may play a card which has a value equal to one of the cards on the table.

Then the defender has the same two options as before, and so on until either the attack succeeds, there are six cards on the table or if any of the two players is out of cards.

#### Drawing cards

After the attack, any cards played during the attack that are still on the table will go face down on a scrap pile.

If the talon (including the last face up trump card) is not yet empty, all players have to take as much cards as needed to get six cards in total, as long as the talon is not empty.
This happens in the order of attacker first, then the player who helped in the attack and then the defender.

If the talon is empty, once a player (except the last one) is out of cards, he did not lose and stops playing.

#### Next attack

After the attack, if the attack succeeded then the first player to the left of the defender who still has cards will start the next turn.

If the attack was beaten off, the first player to the left of the attacker who still has cards will start the next turn (so most of the times the defender).

#### Special rules

If you pick up the six of trumps in your initial hand, you may exchange it with the open card on the table.
This also applies when you pick it up from the talon, but only in the same turn (you cannot exchange it anymore afterwards).

### Continuing play

The loser will deal the next hand.
