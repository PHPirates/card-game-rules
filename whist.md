## Play

### Deal

Each player gets twelve cards, the remaining cards are the kitty.

### Bidding

Starting with the player left of the dealer, each player bids once.
A bid is either a pass or a number in \[3,7\] (we will call this the bid level) together with one of \[uptown, downtown, No Trump\], abbreviated \[:arrow_up:, :arrow_down:, NT\].
In bidding, a NT bid beats a :arrow_down: bid which beats an :arrow_up: bid.

If three players pass, the dealer must bid something which is not a pass.

If someone won the bidding, and the bid was a NT bid, that player has to choose whether to play NT uptown or downtown.
If the winning bid was a number, uptown or downtown, that player has to choose the suit in which to play.

### Winning

You make your bid if you took at least (6 + bid level) tricks, including the kitty which counts for one trick.
Your score is the number of tricks you took (including the kitty) minus 6.

If you fail to make your bid, the bid level is subtracted from your score.

### A turn

The player left of the dealer leads the first trick.

#### Special rules

When a player leads a joker in a NT contract, the suit of the trick is determined by the first non-joker played in that trick.

### Continuing play

The game is over when either team reaches 7 or -7.
